 * Kaolinite is a soft, earthy, usually white mineral but many parts of the world, it is colored pink-orange-red by
 * iron oxide, giving it a distinct rust hue. Kaolinite has also seen some use in organic farming, as a spray applied
 * to crops to deter insect damage, and in the case of apples, to prevent sun scald.
